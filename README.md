A non-AI Voice Assistant (only for MS-Windows) much more efficient than a normal one... having potential to solve simple Mathemetics/Arithmatic problems, can open many popular websites and can make Google searches as per user instructions, and can also make Language Translations for you. In addition to this it can deal with all windows operations(like Working with MS-Word just by listening to user, dealing with recent tabs, increase/decrease system volume/brightness, minimising/closing all open tabs, shut down/reboot your PC or set it to sleep mode and much more only by listening your voice)
